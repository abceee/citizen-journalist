<!--The meta description tag is used below to help improve search rankings, with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647) on how to implement this. Even 
though not all search engines may index what's in the description tag, as Search Engine Watch (2007) suggests, it is still worth doing to enable "some degree 
of control" over what crawlers will see as the website's description. The description has 220 characters (with spaces). According to Search Engine Watch, 
generally between 200 to 250 characters in the content description may be indexed. The description contains keywords clearly describing what the website 
is about.-->

chronic nature, and where citizen journalists can step in to fill the void left by traditional media." />

Engine Watch (2007) and SEO Logic (2001-2011) on the implementation and choice of relevant keywords/ keyword phrases that aptly describe the content information 
and in conjunction with the text found in the body copy. The number of keywords/ keyword phrases are 11 that accurately describe the content on the page, in 
particular reference to SEO Logic's article, without abusing this meta tag. Additionally, the variation of a few keywords are limited, following the guidelines of High

<h2>Underreported issues</h2>
<h3><em>Stories the world should know more about</em></h3>
<p>There are many humanitarian stories that do not attract media attention. Chronic or long-term issues tend to lose in the fight for space in print media 
as new headlining stories come in.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>Plus, there are <strong>not enough journalists</strong> devoted to covering humanitarian situations especially 
involving aid relief efforts.</p>
<p>From time to time, humanitarian organisations like the United Nations and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) would release a list of what 
it deem to be the top humanitarian crises that are largely unreported in media.</p>
<!--OLD COMMENT: I used the target attribtue below to give users the option to view all underreported issues in the United Nations and Médecins Sans Frontières 
reports to ensure that the current page they are on will remain active while incorporating the title attribute to inform them that reading the full report 
will open a new window in view of accessibility as a web standard with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 158).-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: After a considerable amount of thought and research, I have decided not to use the target attribute for these reasons: 1) It reduces usability 
and considered a nuisance as stated in many articles such as Roger Johansson's (2006), Robert Nyman's (2006) and Sven Lennartz (2008).  2) It doesn't validate 
with a Strict document declaration, which I have decided to use instead of Transitional (which allows the target attribute) as mentioned in my comment on the 
index page. As Robert Nyman states, it should be up to the users whether a web page opens in the same window or not. So, I edited the text a bit to indicate 
to readers that if they wish to view the full reports of the UN and Doctors Without Borders, they can click on the link and used the title attribute to 
let them know that doing so will open the reports on the same window.
In addition, the same is done for the list of links in the Useful resources page.-->
<p>The most recent Doctors Without Borders report on underreported humanitarian issues came out in 2009 and among the &ldquo;Top Ten&rdquo; include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Civilians getting killed and neglected</strong> amid long-running conflicts between the army and opposition groups in Pakistan.</li>
<li>Lack of funds to treat <strong>over 10 million people afflicted with HIV/AIDS</strong> in developing countries.</li>
<li><strong>About 3.5 million children</strong> dying from malnutrition every year due scarce funding for treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>To view the full report click <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/topten/2009/" title="Full report opens in same window">here</a>.
</p>
<p>The UN&rsquo;s Department of Public Information listed humanitarian issues that it said hardly garnered media attention such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need to <strong>create strategies to combat climate change</strong> reaching critical point as the planet rapidly warms.</li>
<li>More people are going hungry in poor nations while food prices climb sharply, triggering riots in 40 countries as the <strong>global food crisis</strong>
continues.</li>
<li>Even <strong>space debris</strong> is fast becoming a critical issue, as it <q>threatens sustainable use of outer space</q>.</li>
</ul>
