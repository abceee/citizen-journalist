<!--The meta description tag is used below to help improve search rankings, with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647) on how to implement this. Even 
though not all search engines may index what's in the description tag, as Search Engine Watch (2007) suggests, it is still worth doing to enable "some degree 
of control" over what crawlers will see as the website's description. The description has 233 characters (with spaces). According to Search Engine Watch, 
generally between 200 to 250 characters in the content description may be indexed. The description contains keywords clearly describing what the website 
is about.-->

in recent years, from the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in the US to the flooding in Thailand this year." />
<!--The meta keywords tag is used below and in the rest of the website pages as another SEO means with references to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647), Search 
Engine Watch (2007) and SEO Logic (2001-2011) on the implementation and choice of relevant keywords/ keyword phrases that aptly describe the content information 
and in conjunction with the text found in the body copy. The number of keywords/ keyword phrases are 11 that accurately describe the content on the page, in 
particular reference to SEO Logic's article, without abusing this meta tag. Additionally, the variation of a few keywords are limited, following the guidelines of High 
Rankins (2001) article. -->

<!--OLD COMMENT: The list element is again used below to create a short list of headlines related to humanitarian issues.-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: Similar to what was done to the Wrapping up & extras page, I decided against retaining bullet points and used background images instead to 
indicate visual cues for readers, with reference to Russ Weakley's (2010) tutorial, stating that using a background image to replace bullet points (and 
styling them with CSS) results in consistency across browsers than simply adding images to the HTML page. I used the id selector to style the li element 
unique to this page with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 415).
I also added new text and removed the one on Steve Jobs (originally in the draft website) for a more updated content given that this is the Latest news 
section. The additional textual content is referenced in the Progress Report and included in the Content References List found at the bottom of index page. 
The SOS background image used for this section was cropped from the photo on the Wrapping up & extras page that has already been referenced.-->
<ul id="newslist">
<li>Egyptian violence
<p>United Nations human rights chief Navi Pillay called for an independent investigation into the reported use of force of Egypt's military against protesters, 
who are demanding a return to civilian rule following the ouster of Hosni Mubarak as president earlier this year.
</p>
</li>
<li>Libya conflict
<p>Libya forms Cabinet but faces tough challenges in restoring peace and order in the country not long after Muammar Gadhafi's 42-year-rule ended with his 
death in October at the height of the Libyan uprising.
</p>
</li>
<li>Global peace and security
<p>Senior officials of the United Nations named organised crime, pandemics and the impacts of climate change as the most threatening challenges to 
global peace and security, as the Security Council hold a debate on these issues this month.
</p> 
</li>
<li>Southeast Asia floods
<p>A lone powerful cyclone bearing the international name &ldquo;Nalgae&rdquo; affected three countries in its path namely, the Philippines, China 
and now Thailand. While it is now weakening, it left over 80 people dead in the Philippines and hundreds more in Thailand.
</p>
</li>
<li>Aids report
<p>The latest report on the global AIDS epidemic shows encouraging results amid a decrease in infection rates and deaths related to HIV. The report is 
produced by the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS.
</p>
</li>
<li>Disease outbreak
<p>A deadly outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea has spread across the Horn of Africa with drought, lack of hygiene and persistent regional conflict 
as the major contributing factors cited by the United Nations and World Health Organisation.
</p>
</li>
<li>Tsunami warning system
<p>To avoid a disaster similar to the Indian Ocean tsunami, over 20 nations participated in an exercise to test the &ldquo;UN-backed early warning 
system&rdquo; that reenacted events of the 2004 global tragedy.

<!--OLD COMMENT: The image gallery contains thumbnails that when hovered over will show a larger version of the picture. To achieve this, I came upon the articles of 
Soh Tanak (2010) and Dynamic Drive (2006) on how to make this happen, as presenting photos this way offers attractive and intuitive features as per 
Sven Lennartz's (2007) article. I am hoping to implement this effectively also so that users won't have to see a new window pop-up when clicking for 
the photo's larger version. However, I am still encountering troubles to implement this without the borders moving quite erratically and having the 
captions placed nicely and accessibly.-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: Upon closer look at the examples of image galleries in Sven Lennartz's (2007) Smashing Magazine article using CSS to create the same 
for my website, I found Nathan Smith's tutorial to be the most effective with conditional comments indicated in an IE7 only stylesheet to make it work 
properly in IE7. The id selector is used below to style the elements unique to this page with the images within the unordered list items using the a 
element for the hover to work well with IE7; the class called "preview" for the pop out effect as styled in the main and IE7 only stylesheets; and the 
captions contained in the p element. The source of the images used for both thumbnail version and preview version when hovered over is the same 
(or one image for both) to save on the time it takes to load as well as conserve some space in the entire file of my website, following the tutorial 
of Nathan Smith which works well for the website in different browsers.-->
