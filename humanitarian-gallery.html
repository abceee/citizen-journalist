though not all search engines may index what's in the description tag, as Search Engine Watch (2007) suggests, it is still worth doing to enable "some degree 
of control" over what crawlers will see as the website's description. The description has 231 characters (with spaces). According to Search Engine Watch, 
generally between 200 to 250 characters in the content description may be indexed. The description contains keywords clearly describing what the website 
is about.-->

<p>What do <em>underreported issues</em> mean?</p>
<p>There are many humanitarian stories that do not attract media attention. Chronic or long-term issues tend to lose in the fight for space in print media 
as new headlining stories come in.</p>
<p>Plus, there are not enough journalists devoted to covering humanitarian situations especially involving aid relief efforts.</p>
