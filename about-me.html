<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Ann</strong>.</p>
<p>Writing is my passion and advocacy is my mission. That is, advocacy for anything humanitarian especially sharing to the world socially relevant stories 
that are told truthfully, accurately and compellingly. In my 13 years of journalism experience, no other topic has touched my soul.
</p>
<p>Like you, I strive to keep learning and practising. After all, as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once said: <em>“Education never ends, Watson.”</em>
</p>
<p>In journalism, it couldn’t be any truer. 
</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by and keep writing!</p>

<!--OLD COMMENT: The contact form below is placed within the sidebar div for users to readily see it with reference to Vikash Singh's (2010) article on how to 
create a basic form using HTML and CSS.-->
<!--ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: The form element is used to create the contact form with action defined as "#" as a dummy link, as there is no server to process 
the form and send it to (from my understanding on the "Submit button" thread on the discussion board, forms don't necessarily have to work for this). 
The "post" method is used as a means to send the data from the browser to the server with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 620), which said that "post" 
is the more appropriate method than "get" when sending feedbacks and other private data plus, the textarea element is used for this form specifically 
for user feedback on the site.-->
<div id="sidebar">
<form action="#" method="post">
<!--NEW COMMENT: The class selector is used in order for the several elements within this class to be styled, with reference to W3 Schools (2011) and Freeman 
and Freeman (2006, 415).-->
<div class="box">
<!--NEW COMMENT: The heading to the form is in h4 tag with a short paragraph introducing the means to send their feedback.-->
<h4>What's on your mind?</h4>
<p>Got a feedback or story to share? Or maybe you just want to say hello? Feel free to contact me below.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: The label element is used to enable definition for the input element and according to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 632), allows for easier 
styling using CSS. The input type is indicated as text allowing for a line of text to be entered which would be the name of the user followed by the person's 
email address, and subject of the message.-->
<label>
<!--NEW COMMENT: The span element is used to group together the inline elements, which are styled accordingly in the CSS file with additional reference to 
Freeman and Freeman (2006, 464).-->
<span>Full name</span>
<input type="text" class="input_text" name="name" id="name" />

<span>Email</span>

<span>Subject</span>
<input type="text" class="input_text" name="subject" id="subject" />
</label>
<label>
<span>Message</span>
<!--NEW COMMENT: The textarea class is for entering multiple lines for whatever the user will send, and is further defined with the columns and rows attributes 
for the number of characters to make the textarea.-->
<textarea class="message" name="feedback" id="feedback" rows="6" cols="50"></textarea>
<input type="button" class="button" value="Send" />
