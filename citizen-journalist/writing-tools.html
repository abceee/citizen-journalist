<h2>Writing tools for you</h2>
<p>There is no one correct way of writing stories about humanitarian issues, but you can get your story on track by asking the right questions. 
</p>
<p>Next, look to reliable sources of information to support your story. And then find the angle that will hook your readers and keep them engaged. 
</p>
<p>In the end, a good humanitarian story will help readers (and yourself) get a better understanding of the issues involved whether it involves 
a disaster or a long-running crisis.

<p>When disaster strikes whether natural or man-made, the first question that comes to mind is why did it happen?</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>The question becomes more pressing when it results in loss of lives, displacement of people and destruction of homes and structures.

<p>More importantly, it can also put a much-needed spotlight on long-drawn issues or a crisis 
slowly unfolding &mdash; such as the impact of conflicts, poverty or health risks &mdash; which mainstream media could not cover either due to lack of journalists 
specialising on humanitarian stories or that chronic issues tend to lose in the fight for editorial priority as the headlines keep changing.

<p>Humanitarian issues are as far-reaching as the extent that technological advancement could take us in the world of communications.

<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>Anyone who writes about disasters and crisis cannot be confined to a set number of coverage guidelines.</p> 
<p>But as the global public relies more on citizen journalists for information, their responsibility to provide readers with accurate and informative 
stories is crucial and unavoidable.
