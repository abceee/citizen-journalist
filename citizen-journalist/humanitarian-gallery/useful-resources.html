<!--The meta description tag is used below to help improve search rankings, with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647) on how to implement this. Even 
though not all search engines may index what's in the description tag, as Search Engine Watch (2007) suggests, it is still worth doing to enable "some degree 
of control" over what crawlers will see as the website's description. The description has 237 characters (with spaces). According to Search Engine Watch, 
generally between 200 to 250 characters in the content description may be indexed. The description contains keywords clearly describing what the website 
is about.-->

statistics on climate change and disaster related issues that are useful to both professtional and citizen journalists." />
<!--The meta keywords tag is used below and in the rest of the website pages as another SEO means with references to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647), Search 
Engine Watch (2007) and SEO Logic (2001-2011) on the implementation and choice of relevant keywords/ keyword phrases that aptly describe the content information 
and in conjunction with the text found in the body copy. The number of keywords/ keyword phrases are 8 that accurately describe the content on the page, in 
particular reference to SEO Logic's article, without abusing this meta tag. Additionally, the variation of a few keywords are limited, following the guidelines of High

<h2>Useful resources</h2>
<p>How do you know when a crisis is really a crisis? How can you sense that an emergency is already unravelling?
</p>
<p>These are just a few questions that even professional journalists need help with.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where humanitarian aid agencies are particularly a useful resource. But don&rsquo;t just get their opinion and that&rsquo;s it &ndash; ask what it is based on and double-check your information. 
</p>
<p>Here are some useful resources to check out:</p>
<h3>Humanitarian news websites</h3>
<ul>
<!--The list element is placed below with the bullet points maintained, confirming my earlier design decision that should allow for the links to be scanned 
easily as referenced in my blueprint to Anthony Tseng (2010).-->
<!--OLD COMMENT: I used the target attribtue below for the website links of Useful Resources to open in a new window while ensuring that the title attribute 
is incorporated to inform them that a new window will open once the link is clicked on, with reference again to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 158).-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: I removed the underline from the links that were visible in the draft website to avoid cluttering the page with it and since it is already 
obvious that the list are links in view of the colour and the accompanying text as well as in reference to Jakob Nielsen's (2004) article, stating that 
underlines can be safely removed because users typically understand the function of links as long as visual appearance is clear on that. As stated in my 
progress report, the list items become underlined when hovered over as an accessibility function.
As mentioned in the Underreported issues section, I have decided not to use the target attribute for the links so as not to reduce usability and in order 
for the document to validate in view of my decision to use Strict declaration for the website to keep up to standards and for good web design practice. The 
title attribute is kept for a short information on each link and to let users know that clicking on it will open in the same window.-->
