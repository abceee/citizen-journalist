<!--The meta description tag is used below to help improve search rankings, with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647) on how to implement this. Even 
though not all search engines may index what's in the description tag, as Search Engine Watch (2007) suggests, it is still worth doing to enable "some degree 
of control" over what crawlers will see as the website's description. The description has 228 characters (with spaces). According to Search Engine Watch, 
generally between 200 to 250 characters in the content description may be indexed. The description contains keywords clearly describing what the website

<h2>Finding your angle</h2>
<p>Giving your story a good angle draws in your audience.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>More importantly, it can also put a much-needed spotlight on long-drawn issues or a crisis slowly 
unfolding &mdash; such as the impact of conflicts, poverty or health risks &mdash; which mainstream media could not cover either due to lack of journalists specialising 
on humanitarian stories or that chronic issues tend to lose in the fight for editorial priority as the headlines keep changing. 
</p>
<h3>Humanising your story</h3>
<!--NEW COMMENT: Similar to my comments on the Asking focused questions page, I used the class attribute to style the headings with a background image 
created in Photoshop, and the span class to align the text with references again to the articles of W3 Schools (2011), Michael Martin (2009) and 
Anthony Tseng (2011).-->
<h4 class="heading-background2">
<span class="align">Put a face to the people behind the numbers</span>
</h4>
<p>
There is more to writing humanitarian features than just laying out facts and figures. The key is to get the public’s attention to the <strong>&lsquo;human&rsquo;
</strong>in <strong>&lsquo;humanitarian&rsquo;</strong>. 
</p>
<p>Telling the story through the eyes of individuals will allow your readers to see the big picture.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>In the initial hours following a disaster like an earthquake, the first responders are in many cases the victims themselves. 
</p>
<h4 class="heading-background2">
<span class="align">Get to know the grassroots and find connections around you</span>
</h4>
<p>Websites of aid organisations and humanitarian news services feature surveys on various issues and profiles of countries particularly prone 
to humanitarian crisis.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>Again go beyond the figures, as these resources can help you better understand people’s backgrounds, cultures and beliefs that could 
in part explain their plight. 
</p>
<p><strong>Look around you:</strong> What humanitarian issue do you feel the world should know more about? Connect with your community and see what you can uncover. 
</p>
<h4 class="heading-background2">
<span class="align">Anniversary stories and keeping track of progress</span>
</h4>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A closing p tag was initially not placed in the draft website and corrected below.-->
<p>A disaster or crisis is put back into the spotlight usually a few months after it took place and followed up a year after. It poses questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are survivors coping and recovering? What about those who lost loved ones?</li>
<li>What has been done to improve on the early warning system such as in the case of a tsunami or flooding disaster?</li>
<li>Aid agencies are not only there for relief efforts. They can help residents become more resilient. How have they helped residents in that regard?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample Situation:</strong> In a <em>Courier Mail</em> article on Cyclone Yasi’s post-devastation of north Queensland entitled &ldquo;Six months after 
Cyclone Yasi, heartbreak remains&rdquo;, it highlights the long wait for thousands of affected people to get replies to their insurance claims.
</p>
<h3>Offbeat &amp; off-stage</h3>
<h4 class="heading-background2">
<span class="align">Offbeat angles lighten the touch of the story</span>
</h4>
<p>Humanitarian stories are not always about tragedy and misery</p>
<p>Donkeys coming to the rescue of Pakistanis affected by massive flooding in 2010 to bring relief supplies is an example of an offbeat story. Or, locals 
tapping into elephants to clear up debris following the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.</p>
<p>Stories like these highlight the resourcefulness of people particularly 
in times of crisis.
</p>
<h4 class="heading-background2">
<span class="align">Drawing on &lsquo;star&rsquo; power</span>
</h4>
<p>Off the stage and outside the glitter of show business, more and more celebrities are joining the humanitarian cause and are making headlines 
because of this.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>But there is a tendency for the coverage to either be short-term or that the celebrity becomes the focus of stories rather than the issue.
</p>
<p>What can you do to make the most of celebrity power to highlight a cause without making it about the celebrity?
