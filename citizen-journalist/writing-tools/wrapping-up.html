<!--The meta description tag is used below to help improve search rankings, with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647) on how to implement this. Even 
though not all search engines may index what's in the description tag, as Search Engine Watch (2007) suggests, it is still worth doing to enable "some degree 
of control" over what crawlers will see as the website's description. The description has 246 characters (with spaces). According to Search Engine Watch, 
generally between 200 to 250 characters in the content description may be indexed. The description contains keywords clearly describing what the website 
is about.-->

professional journalist. It also contains tips on how to add colour to your story using descriptive methods, quotes and analogies." />

<h2>Wrapping up &amp; extras</h2>
<p>Humanitarian issues are as far-reaching as the extent that technological advancement could take us in the world of communications.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>Anyone who writes about disasters and crisis cannot be confined to a set number of coverage guidelines.</p>
<p>But as the global public relies more on citizen journalists for information, their responsibility to provide readers with accurate and informative 
stories is crucial and unavoidable.</p>
<!--OLD COMMENT: The list element is used to recap the main points of writing about humanitarian stories. I was going to use an icons class similar to the 
first two sections (Asking focused questions and Finding your angle), however, I thought it better not to bombard users with too many icons as it would come 
out had I used them for this long list of brief paragraphs. But I aim to improve on the appearance of this page for final website assignment.-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: I decided to use icons in the end for this part of the page, as explained in the Progress Report with reference to Max Design's tutorial. I 
used Photoshop to create the icon for the main learning points used the id attribute to define the unordered list unique to this page.-->
<p>This is another way for citizen journalists to step in to fill the void left by traditional media, and step up to take on the challenging role 
of journalism especially if you speak the language and familiar with local politics and culture.
</p>
<p>This online tutorial has tackled some general writing ideas and pointers. It&rsquo;s up to you to discover more avenues to tell your story to the world.
</p>
<p><strong>Let's recap the main learning points:</strong></p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: I decided against retaining bullet points to highlight the basic tips in this part of the page and used icons instead to indicate visual cues 
for readers, with reference to Russ Weakley's (2010) tutorial, stating that using a background image to replace bullet points (and styling them with CSS) 
results in consistency across browsers than simply adding images to the HTML page. Using the ul id "checklist" is done as this is unique to this page.-->
<ul id="checklist">
<li>Asking the right questions fetch meaningful answers and help your story get on track </li>
<li>Weigh up all possible causes of a disaster or a humanitarian crisis </li>
<li>Go beyond the numbers - use story angles that capture the hearts and minds of your readers </li>
<li>Like any news or feature, a story has to be supported by facts with the proper attribution to sources </li>
<li>Turn to reliable sources of information such as humanitarian agencies and humanitarian news websites </li>
<li>Draw in your audience with story angles that connect to them </li>
<li>Look around your community. There could be issues that need to be told </li>
<li>Take advantage of gaps in media coverage of long-running and chronic issues </li>
<li>Above all, be a responsible citizen journalist! Keep that in mind, as the power of information lies (literally) at your fingertips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Extras: Adding colour to your story</h3>
<p>Do remember that feature stories give any writer the flexibility to be more colourful in style to make the substance of the story come out 
more. Here are a few basic tips:

with the page appearance as well as to indicate visual cues for readers, with reference to Russ Weakley's (2010) tutorial. Using the ul id "tips" is done as 
this is unique to this page.-->
<ul id="tips">
<li>Be descriptive
<p>Connect with your readers and make them feel like they are right there in the situation by painting a vivid description of the scenes. Characterise the 
individuals involved in the story by describing them and the emotions they are showing.</p>
</li>
<li>Use meaningful quotes
<p>This helps readers get a real sense of the experience and liven up your story.</p>
</li>
<li>Use analogies and figures of speech
<p>Used appropriately and you can effectively explain complex situations to your readers.</p>
</li>
<li>Don't keep your readers hanging
<p>End your story well. Either give it a sense of unity by closing with the same idea your story started out with, or give readers something to think about 
in the end.</p>
<p>When possible, end on a positive note, keeping in mind that not all humanitarian issues are about gloom and doom.</p>
