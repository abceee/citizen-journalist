<h2>Asking focused questions</h2>
<p>When disaster strikes whether natural or man-made, the first question that comes to mind is why did it happen?</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>The question becomes more pressing when it results in loss of lives, displacement of people and destruction of homes and structures. 
</p>
<h3>The basics</h3>
<!--Icons created from Photoshop are defined by the class attribute in this section and the Finding your angle topic to provide visual accompaniment 
to the text and provide a break between paragraphs as highlighted in Jacob Gube's (2009) article. Similar to the floated images on my homepage, Writing 
Tools and Humanitarian Gallery sections, I implemented this using the combined knowledge I gained from the Freeman and Freeman (2006, 199) textbook and 
Louis Lazaris' (2009) article on the CSS float property.-->
<!--The h4 element is used in all three sections under Writing Tools in specifically tackling the main points of how to write humanitarian stories. In terms of SEO best practices, I also learned from Jeffrey Way's (2009)
article that when appropriate, use all h1 to h6 tags for semantic purposes and to improve search engine visibility. For my website, the farthest I believe I can go for appropriate application 
of this technique is the h4 tag.-->
<h4 class="heading-background1">
<span class="align">Was it really climate change?</span>
</h4>
<p>Asking if climate change caused a disaster or humanitarian situation cannot be avoided. However, avoid loosely attributing every natural disaster or 
freakish weather event to it. 
</p>
<p>Assess the factors first that caused the disaster by looking into reliable sources of information from humanitarian organisations like the <em>United 
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</em> or humanitarian news websites like <em>AlertNet</em>.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>Many of these organisations have readily accessible and easy to grasp data on climate change and other humanitarian topics. 
</p>
<h4 class="heading-background1">
<span class="align">Could the disaster or loss of lives have been avoided?</span>
</h4>
<p>
Earthquakes are unpredictable but the disaster takes on a whole new meaning when the loss of lives reaches humanitarian proportions. 
</p>
<p><strong>Sample Situation:</strong> In the 2008 massive earthquake in the Sichuan province of China, some 70,000 people were killed including thousands 
of children when their schools collapsed. Building codes and standards were questioned. 
</p>
<p>Who is to blame?</p>
<h4 class="heading-background1">
<span class="align">What efforts are being made to prevent disasters?</span>
</h4>
<p>This involves not just governments but communities and the humanitarian aid industry.</p>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>It can tackle partnerships being forged for the common goal of providing a safer and sustainable environment.
</p>
<p>What consultations are aid agencies conducting with locals to make them more prepared? Are you familiar with how these consultations go and what 
they accomplish? 
</p>
<!--OLD COMMENT: Icons created from Photoshop are defined by the class attribute in this section and the Finding your angle topic to provide visual accompaniment 
to the text and provide a break between paragraphs as highlighted in Jacob Gube's (2009) article. Similar to the floated images on my homepage, Writing

Louis Lazaris' (2009) article on the CSS float property.-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: In order to improve on content chunking and design, I used the class attribute to style the background of the series of h4s found on this 
page using my own basic knowledge of Photoshop combined with the unit's tutorials to create the background image. 
The classname has the number "1" in it, as I applied similar styling to the Finding your angle page to maintain a form of consistency in the tutorial 
although a different background image is used for that page hence, its name is "heading-background2". According to W3 Schools (2011), digits are allowed in 
the naming rules it specified. 
The span tag is used with the class attribute in order to set the alignment of the text in the h4 and not overlap with the "question mark" in the background 
image, with reference to W3 Schools (2011).
Overall, I was guided by the articles of Michael Martin (2009) on the importance of using backgrounds styled with CSS and Anthony Tseng (2011) on how I 
can improve on the design and content appearance of my website particularly on Writing tools section, which contains the most text.-->
<h4 class="heading-background1">
<span class="align">How has a disaster affected relevant industries?</span>
</h4>
<p>Tourism, for example, is one industry that almost immediately feels the impact of a natural disaster especially if the place is prone to it 
like cyclones and flooding in Queensland, Australia. 
</p>
<h3>Getting more in-depth</h3>
<h4 class="heading-background1">
<span class="align">What other disaster factors are we overlooking?</span>
</h4>
<!--NEW COMMENT: A closing p tag was initially not placed in the draft website and corrected below.-->
<p>Consider this: The rapid growth of towns and cities, or urbanisation, is increasingly becoming a concern for the United Nations as it fuels 
the risks of a disaster.</p> 
<p>How are these cities addressing this concern?</p>  
<h4 class="heading-background1">
<span class="align">What are the other possible impacts of climate change?</span>
</h4>
<p>Beyond floods, cyclones and earthquakes, experts predict more migration of so-called climate refugees, food and water shortages, outbreaks 
of disease and conflict as a result of climate change.</p> 
<p>Can you find the connection?</p>
