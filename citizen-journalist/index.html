<!--NEW COMMENT: Comments on W3C standards compliance and recommendations were overlooked in the draf website and now placed to show understanding of 
why the tags are indicated on all pages.-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: Every page starts with the DOCTYPE declaration to be standards compliant (as per W3C) to ensure that all pages are consistently 
displayed across browsers with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 253). From XHTML 1.0 Transitional in the draft website, I changed the declaration to 
XHTML 1.0 Strict for better structure and adaptability to style in different browsers while I learn how to keep my website up to up-to-date standards with 
strict rules to go by, with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 251).-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: As a required tag in XHTML documents, the xmlns attribute is placed on all web pages as defined by W3C (with the w3c url specified), and the 
"en" or English language specified, following W3C Recommendations with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 274) textbook on the proper implementation of 
XHTML.-->
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<!--NEW COMMENT: Following Freeman and Freeman's tutorial (2006, 240), the meta tag to specify content type including character encoding type below goes in the 
head element. UTF-8 is used as recommended by W3C as well as by tutors on the discussion board. It is ensured that all pages are encoded without the "Unicode 
Byte-Order Mark (BOM)", as the W3C states it is known to cause problems for some text editors and older browsers.-->
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
<!--NEW COMMENT: The title below clearly describes information found on the page, which in this case is the home page hence, the title is specific to what 
the website is about with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 23). When the page is bookmarked or added to favorites, the title shows up as such. 
The words used in the title relate to the keywords that rank high in Google and Bing search engine results, as indicated when I made my research for the 
blueprint assignment amid the growing involvement of Web users in citizen journalism and humanitarian topics. Also in maintaning my decision stated in 
the blueprint on file naming, I used relevant keywords without spaces (using the hyphen for more than two words as good practice), in lowercase and as 
short as possible to improve search rank chances with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006), Search Engine Watch (2007) and High Rankings (2001).-->
<title>Humanitarian Writing for Citizen Journalists</title>
<!--The meta description tag is used below to help improve search rankings, with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647) on how to implement this. Even 
though not all search engines may index what's in the description tag, as Search Engine Watch (2007) suggests, it is still worth doing to enable "some degree 
of control" over what crawlers will see as the website's description. The description has 247 characters (with space). According to Search Engine Watch, 
generally between 200 to 250 characters in the content description may be indexed. The description contains keywords clearly describing what the website 
is about.-->
<meta name="description" content="This website explains how citizen journalists such as bloggers and anyone wired to the Internet can write about 
humanitarian issues like a professional journalist would. This website also contains humanitarian photos and links to useful resources." />
<!--The meta keywords tag is used below and in the rest of the website pages as another SEO means with references to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 647), Search 
Engine Watch (2007) and SEO Logic (2001-2011) on the implementation and choice of relevant keywords/ keyword phrases that aptly describe the content information 
and in conjunction with the text found in the body copy. The number of keywords/ keyword phrases are 11 that accurately describe the page, in particular 
reference to SEO Logic's article, without abusing this meta tag. Additionally, the variation of a few keywords are limited, following the guidelines of High 
Rankings (2001) article.-->
<meta name="keywords" content="citizen journalist, citizen journalism, bloggers, blogs, social networking, breaking news, fifth estate, humanitarian crisis, 
humanitarian writing, disaster stories, underreported issues." />

<body>
<!--Divs are used throughout the design to provide structure to the main elements of my website, following Freeman and Freeman's (2006, 433) advice 
on grouping main sections logically to make it easier to style them.-->
<!--To achieve the desired structure stated above, I was guided by the tutorial of Russ Weakley (2010) specifically on a having a three-column layout, 
which my website has. The div container below is used to "contain" the main elements of my website. It helped me specify properties like margins, background 
and specifically the width to the ideal 960px size as per the advice of tutors on NED11's discussion board and in following one of the accessibility guidelines 
I have previously referenced in my blueprint to Vitaly Friedman (2007), who said that content on the web must be presented within 1000px.-->
<!--As for font sizes throughout the website, I was guided by the Freeman and Freeman (2006, 354) chapter on using keywords (mainly small and x-small) combined with percentages to 
specify them for a more consistent appearance on browers. I also learned from Freeman and Freeman (2006, 358) how to change a font's weight using the 
font-weight property specifically used in my website's headings.-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: In naming the elements, I was guided by Jacob Gube's (2008) article, stating that the description should be about the actual purpose of say, a div or id 
or what they are or what they do.-->
<div id="container">
<!--The div header falls under the div container along with the main navigation, local navigation, content,sidebar and footer. I was guided by the tutorial 
of Russ Weakley (2010) as mentioned above.-->
<!--The use of id attriutes used throughout the website design follows Freeman and Freeman's (2006, 415) guidelines on what elements are to be styled uniquely 
because they appear only once on the page. For my website, this was used with the div element to style my header, navigation menus, sidebar and foooter 
as well as the divs containing these.-->
<div id="header">
<!--The h1 and h3 elements are used throughout the website to provide the title of the website and tagline.
NEW COMMENT: The website title is now linked to the homepage on every page of the website, following Lee Munroe's (2010) article on Smashing Magazine, stating that users tend to 
look for the "Home" link (which I myself do by clicking on the banner even in the absence of a logo) in spite the presence of the main navigation bar. Styling 
is also applied using a background image for the header (please see master css file).-->
<h1>
<a href="index.html">The Humanitarian Fifth Estate</a>

<!--NEW COMMENT: The proper HTML entity for the single quotation mark is used in the tagline found throughout the website with reference to Harry Roberts' 
(2011) article on technical typography on the Web.-->

</div>
<!--To create the main navigation, I used an unordered list wrapped in a div as I learned this solution to be semantically sound as well as good for accessibility 
and usability, coinciding with my website objectives. Using the list element is implemented with reference to the articles of Soh Tanaka (2009), Rachel Andrew 
(2009) and Roger Johansson (2005).-->
<div id="navigation">
<!--NEW COMMENT (WITH ADDITIONAL REFERENCES ON TOP OF FREEMAN & FREEMAN): The title attribute is used for the Writing Tools and Humanitarian Gallery menu links 
in the main navigation to adhere to the standard accessibility guideline of the W3C (2008) as a useful feature particularly to the visually impaired. Proper 
implementation was done using knowledge gained from the Freeman and Freeman (2006, 149) textbook and upon checking with best practices and guidelines in articles 
from Search Engine Journal(2008), Roger Johansson (2004) and Jakob Nielsen (1998).
NEW COMMENT: The title attribute is not used for the links to index/ home page, About me & contact as well as with other links that, from the link anchors, are 
already obvious to users where they will be led to when they click on it. This is in reference to the articles of Ann Smarty (2008) and Jakob Nielsen 1998).-->

that a left-hand side vertical navigation will be used for my sub-menus as a usable method in reference to Cameron Chapman's (2011) article, which 
mentioned that most users tend to read or scan a page from left to right. In implementing this particular style, I was guided by Mark Newhouse's (2002) 
article with additional references to the articles of Soh Tanaka (2009), Rachel Andrew (2009) and Roger Johansson (2005) on turning lists into navigation 
menus. In creating this along with the horizontal navigation, I learned that simply specifying the list-style to "none" will remove the bullets. Indicating 
that the display is "inline" as against to "block" spells the difference between having a horizontal and vertical style of menu. -->
<!--NEW COMMENT: The tutorial of Max Design (2010) was unintentionally overlooked in the draft website as a reference to the creation of my vertical navigation 
particularly on making the left-indentation of unordered lists work for different browsers by specifying the margin and padding values to "0" and targetting 
nested list items to make a visual distinction between the main sections (Writing Tools and Humanitarian Gallery) and the sub-sections of each.-->

<!--This div is used to give structure to the content of the website again in reference to Russ Weakley's (2002) article on having a three-column layout 
design. This particular section falls under the second column of the layout. The article helped me define the appropriate width, margin and padding while 
using the float element. I used the line height and length properties for optimal legibility and white space consideration as per Vitaly Friedman's (2007) 
recommendation to have between 60-80 characters per line to achieve this. The text on my website has an average of 60 characters per line using the font types 
I have specified in my blueprint and identified in the stylesheet by their corresponding font-families namely, "Arial, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif" for headings 
and "Georgia, Times, serif" for the body with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 347) on how font-family specifications work.-->
<div id="content">
<!--The h2 tag is used throughout the website to provide heading to the text that introduces what a particular web page or section contains and other 
information.-->
<h2>Mobilising citizen journalists for humanitarian coverage</h2>
<p>Never has citizen journalism become more relevant, vital and even controversial in the delivery of news and information in this day and age.</p>
<!--OLD COMMENT: The <q> element is used for throughout the website instead of typing in double quotes to follow proper structuring of texts as per the advice 
of Freeman and Freeman (2006, 87).-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: The HTML entity for double quotation marks is used, with reference again to Harry Roberts' (2011) article on Smashing Magazine, to replace 
the <q> element initially used for quoted phrases. The double quotes using the <q> element do not show in IE7.
The <strong> and <em> elements are used below and throughout the website (but not excessively) to emphasize certain key phrases, not for the purpose of 
styling them with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 362). -->
<p>Bloggers and practically anyone wired to the Internet &ndash; otherwise known as the <strong>&ldquo;Fifth Estate&rdquo;</strong> &ndash; are beating traditional media to the punch in breaking 
news stories. This is particularly evident in disasters and humanitarian crises with netizens crowding social media with information faster than you can say &lsquo;tweet&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>But beyond breaking news lies an abundance of issues in humanitarian emergencies.</p> 
<!--NEW COMMENT: A new paragraph is created to create space with reference to Web Designer Wall's (2007) guidelines on creating space for my website's content.-->
<p>Professional journalists specialising in humanitarian coverage are lacking in 
numbers. This is where citizen journalists can step in to fill the void through the art of storytelling, guided by journalistic values that many media 
professionals say are lost in the wired, wired world of social networking.

<!--The h3 tag is used throughout the website to introduce the two sub-menus of the website with both the headings and images linking directly to their 
respective pages. More about this below.-->
<h3>
<!--The <a> element with the href attribute is used below to create links out of the images, which I have made into thumbnail versions of the main photos 
found on the sub-menus namely, Writing Tools and Humanitarian Gallery. I was able to do this using the knowledge I gained from Freeman and Freeman's (2006, 199) 
textbook.-->
<!--I learned to float the images to the left with the text wrapping them by following Louis Lazaris' (2009) tutorial on the CSS float property.-->

<p>How do you combine journalistic training and values with ordinary citizens&rsquo; passion for online storytelling? This online tutorial is designed to help 
you, the citizen journalist, write humanitarian stories like a professional would with the following as <strong>guiding principles</strong>: 
</p>
<ul>
<!--The "guiding principles" of the Writing Tools sub-menu is highlighted and separated from the introduction using the unordered list element, learned from 
the Freeman and Freeman (2006, 105) textbook.-->
<li>Practising accuracy and striking for balance in a story</li>
<li>Finding creative ways to write compelling stories</li>
<li>Gaining a more informed view of humanitarian issues</li>
</ul>
<!--I used the button element as a means of asking readers to know more about the topic on the page (in this case, how to write humanitarian stories, which 
offers the main substance of the website guided by steps on how to write such stories). From reading the articles of Janko Jovanovic (2009), Jakob Nielsen 
(2007) and Andrew Maier (2008), I felt this was the way to go as a "call to action" means so that readers can learn more about or start exploring the topic. I 
used the button element specifically for Writing Tools.--> 
<!--The class attribute is used for the button guided by the tutorial of Janko Jovanovic (2009) on its basic styling. I applied my basic knowledge of Photoshop 
combined with the tutorials from different modules in NED11 to create a button image used in Writing Tools and its sub-sections. I learned how to use the 
background-image property and make it work together with the text written in HTML with reference to Freeman and Freeman (2006, 404) on adding background images.-->

simple element in mind as a usable feature of a website, according to an article by Matt Cronin (2009), among others that have highlighted the importance 
of having this function available to users. Although Cronin's article mentioned that this link is usually found in the footer, I decided to use it after 
the text of the main content and just above the footer itself because it appears to be more visible that way.-->
<a href="index.html">Back to top</a>

<!--The div below is used as part of what I learned from Russ Weakley's (2010) layout tutorial along with Max Design's. In this case, I used the sidebar to 
contain several images appearing throughout the website and make them float along with the blockquotes, which have the background image I have modified 
using Photoshop.-->
<!--NEW COMMENT: The div class named "floatright" replaced the img class in the draft website in order to float both images and captions within the sidebar 
div which I initially had trouble doing. But with combined references to Max Design's tutorial (2010) and Bert Bos' article (2011), I was able to implement 
the desired changes. The same knowledge gained from Louis Lazaris' (2009) article on the CSS float property is applied in order to let the captions wrap 
around the floated images.-->
<div id="sidebar">

let them guess what's going on in the picture) with reference to Cameron Chapman's (2006) article.-->
<p>TIME named ordinary citizens as Person of the Year in 2006 amid the rise of user-generated content on the Web and subsequent transformation of the
